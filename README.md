# heatSim2
2nd version of HeatSim

Now using the paradigm of shared memory in multi-threaded programming.
This program will prematurelly exit if the new values calculated are below an arbitrary value defined by the user.
This program will also periodically save the status of the matrix to a file (the periocity and filename defined by the user)
and if it receives a SIGINT signal.
